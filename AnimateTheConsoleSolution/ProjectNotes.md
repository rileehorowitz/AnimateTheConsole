- Add a menu that asks if you're converting images to ascii or displaying ascii from a folder
- - request a file path that can be used by the app to grab folders of images from anywhere and put them anywhere

- Organize code into classes. Encapsulate more.

- Pull images into a list of images inside one using block instead of pulling from individual files in a for loop. (line 267)

- Set up character dictionaries with multiple fill character options, and have the converter randomly choose from various fill characters.

- Set color themes for different "videos" based on brightness, Foreground and Background. Maybe pull colors from image to dynamically create pallet

- Solve (the anti-life equations) how to accomplish the more detailed version of image-to-ascii conversion
